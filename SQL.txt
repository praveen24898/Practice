1. What is SQL?

Answer: SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

2. What is a database?
Answer: A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for efficient retrieval and manipulation.

3. Explain the difference between SQL and MySQL.
Answer: SQL is a language used to manage and manipulate relational databases, while MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its query language.

4. What is a primary key?
Answer: A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and helps maintain data integrity.

5. What is a foreign key?
Answer: A foreign key is a field in a database table that is used to establish a link between the data in two tables. It creates a relationship between the tables by referencing the primary key of another table.


6. Explain the types of SQL commands.

Answer: SQL commands can be broadly categorized into Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Query Language
(DQL), and Data Control Language (DCL).

 7. What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types?
Answer: CHAR is a fixed-length character data type, while VARCHAR is a variable-length character data type. VARCHAR is more flexible as it only stores the characters entered, whereas CHAR pads the remaining spaces with blanks.

8. What is normalization?

Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them.


9. Explain the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN.

Answer: INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables, while LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table…

 13. What is a stored procedure?
Answer: A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. It is stored in the database and can be called by name.

14. Explain the ACID properties of a transaction.
Answer: ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.

15. What is the purpose of the HAVING clause?
Answer: The HAVING clause is used in combination with the GROUP BY clause to filter the results of a group based on a specified condition.

16. What is a view in SQL?
Answer: A view is a virtual table derived from one or more tables. It does not store the data itself but provides a way to represent the result of a stored query.

17. Explain the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index.
Answer: A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table, whereas a non-clustered index does not affect the physical order and creates a separate structure for faster data retrieval.

18. What is the purpose of the SQL ORDER BY clause?
Answer: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set of a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.

19. What is a trigger?
Answer: A trigger is a set of instructions that are automatically executed (o
"triggered") in response to certain events on a particular table or view in a
老
database.
